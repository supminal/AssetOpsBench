## üìã Track 1: Enhanced Task Planning Solution

### File Modified
- `src/agent_hive/workflows/track1_planning.py`

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Enhanced Agent Description Formatting** (Lines 96-130)

**What was changed:**
- Added visual separators and emojis for better readability
- Introduced structured capability tags for each agent
- Added "Best Used For" guidelines to help the LLM choose the right agent
- Improved task example formatting with numbered lists

**Implementation highlights:**
```python
# Added visual headers for each agent
agent_descriptions += f"ü§ñ AGENT #{ii + 1}: {aagent.name}\n"

# Added capability tags from predefined mapping
if aagent.name in AGENT_CAPABILITIES:
    capabilities = AGENT_CAPABILITIES[aagent.name]
    agent_descriptions += f"\nüéØ Key Capabilities:\n"
    for cap in capabilities:
        agent_descriptions += f"   ‚úì {cap}\n"

# Added usage guidelines specific to each agent type
agent_descriptions += f"\nüìù Best Used For: "
if "IoT" in aagent.name:
    agent_descriptions += "Retrieving real-time sensor data..."
```

**Benefits:**
- LLM can better understand agent capabilities at a glance
- Visual hierarchy helps with prompt parsing
- Reduces ambiguity in agent selection

#### 2. **Comprehensive Planning Prompt** (Lines 217-292)

**What was changed:**
- Created a multi-section structured prompt with clear visual hierarchy
- Added explicit planning strategy guidance (5-step process)
- Included quality checklist for self-validation
- Enhanced format examples with detailed annotations
- Added critical rules section with clear constraints

**Key sections:**
1. **Mission Statement**: Sets the context and role
2. **Critical Planning Rules**: Constraints in a bordered box
3. **Planning Strategy**: 5-step methodology for creating plans
4. **Required Output Format**: Detailed examples with annotations
5. **Available Agents**: Enhanced agent information
6. **Problem Statement**: The actual task to solve
7. **Quality Checklist**: Self-validation criteria

**Benefits:**
- LLM receives clear, unambiguous instructions
- Reduces plan generation errors
- Encourages optimal step count (‚â§5 steps)
- Better agent-to-task matching

#### 3. **Agent Capability Mapping** (Lines 20-33)

**What was added:**
- Created `AGENT_CAPABILITIES` dictionary mapping agents to their key capabilities
- Added `COMPLEXITY_KEYWORDS` for potential future enhancements

**Purpose:**
- Provides structured metadata about each agent
- Can be extended for more sophisticated agent selection

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Better Plan Quality**: More specific, actionable task descriptions
2. **Improved Agent Selection**: LLM chooses agents based on clear capability descriptions
3. **Reduced Errors**: Fewer invalid plans due to better formatting guidance
4. **Higher Success Rate**: Clearer dependencies and expected outputs

## üîß Track 2: Dynamic Multi-Agent Execution Solution

### File Modified
- `src/agent_hive/workflows/track2_execution.py`

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Implemented TaskRevisionHelperAgent** (Lines 82-115)

**What was implemented:**
- Quality assessment based on multiple criteria:
  - Response length (longer = more detailed)
  - Data presence (keywords indicating actual results)
  - Error detection (keywords indicating failures)
  - Quality scoring system (0-10 scale)

**Logic:**
```python
# Quality assessment
response_length = len(task_input.strip())
has_data = any(keyword in task_input.lower() for keyword in 
              ['found', 'data', 'value', 'result', 'output', 'analysis'])
has_error = any(keyword in task_input.lower() for keyword in 
               ['error', 'failed', 'unable', 'could not', 'exception'])

# Quality score calculation
quality_score = 0
if response_length > 50: quality_score += 3
if response_length > 150: quality_score += 2
if has_data: quality_score += 3
if not has_error: quality_score += 2
```

**Benefits:**
- Cleans up responses automatically
- Adds context markers for low-quality responses
- Removes residual "Final Answer:" prefixes

#### 2. **Enhanced Execution Strategy with Fallback** (Lines 189-260)

**What was implemented:**

##### A. **Multi-Agent Fallback Strategy**
- Primary agent execution with quality threshold (0.6)
- Automatic fallback to secondary agents if quality is low
- Up to 3 agents tried per task (1 primary + 2 fallbacks)

```python
# Try primary agent first
response = assigned_agents[0].execute_task(user_input)
response_quality = self._assess_response_quality(response)

if response_quality >= 0.6:
    execution_success = True
else:
    # Try fallback agents
    for fallback_idx in range(1, min(len(assigned_agents), 3)):
        fallback_response = assigned_agents[fallback_idx].execute_task(user_input)
        # Use if quality is better
        if fallback_quality > original_quality:
            response = fallback_response
            break
```

##### B. **Exception Handling**
- Graceful handling of agent failures
- Continues execution even if individual agents fail
- Logs warnings for debugging

##### C. **Quality-Based Agent Selection**
- Compares response quality between agents
- Selects the best response across multiple attempts
- Uses quantitative scoring for objective comparison

#### 3. **Response Quality Assessment Method** (Lines 266-309)

**What was added:**
- New helper method `_assess_response_quality()` that scores responses on 0.0-1.0 scale

**Scoring factors:**
1. **Length Factor** (up to 0.3): Longer responses typically more detailed
2. **Data Presence** (up to 0.3): Keywords indicating actual data/results
3. **Error Indicators** (up to -0.4): Negative score for error keywords
4. **Completeness** (up to 0.2): Success/completion indicators
5. **Structure** (up to 0.2): Formatted data (newlines, numbers, delimiters)

**Benefits:**
- Objective quality measurement
- Enables intelligent agent selection
- Improves overall workflow reliability

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Higher Task Success Rate**: Fallback agents compensate for primary agent failures
2. **Better Response Quality**: Quality assessment filters poor responses
3. **Increased Robustness**: Exception handling prevents workflow crashes
4. **Improved Reliability**: Multi-agent approach provides redundancy
