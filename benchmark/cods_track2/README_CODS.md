# AssetOpsBench Setup Guide

This guide describes how to fork, configure, and run the **AssetOpsBench** project using Conda and Docker on macOS.

---

## 1. Fork to Your Own Project

This guide shows how to create your own copy of the **IBM/AssetOpsBench** project on GitHub, using only the web browser.  
A fork lets you experiment and make changes without affecting the original project.

---

### Step 1 — Log in to GitHub
1. Open [https://github.com](https://github.com) in your browser.  
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.  
   - If you don’t have one, click **Sign up** to create a free account.

---

### Step 2 — Navigate to the Original Repository
1. In the search bar at the top of GitHub, type **IBM/AssetOpsBench**.  
2. Click on the repository link, or go directly to:  
   👉 [https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench)

---

### Step 3 — Required Branch for This Work
The repository contains multiple branches, but for this purpose you will only use:

- **`Competition_CODS`** → this branch contains the competition-specific code and materials.  

👉 You still need to fork with **all branches** available so you can access `Competition_CODS`.

---

### Step 4 — Create the Fork
1. On the top-right of the page, click the **Fork** button.

2. On the fork setup page:  
   - Make sure your own GitHub account is selected as the destination.  
   - **Important:** Uncheck the option **“Copy the `main` branch only.”**  
     - Leaving it checked will copy only `main`.  
     - Unchecking ensures you also get **`Competition_CODS`** and other branches.  

3. Click **Create fork**.

---

### Step 5 — Switch to the `Competition_CODS` Branch
1. Go to your forked repository:  
   👉 `https://github.com/<your-username>/AssetOpsBench`

2. Open the **Branch dropdown menu** (upper-left, just above the file list).  
   
3. Select **`Competition_CODS`** from the list.  
   - This switches your forked repository view to the competition branch.  

---

### Step 6 — Verify Your Fork
- After switching, confirm that the branch name `Competition_CODS` is shown at the top-left of the repository.  
- All further work for the competition should be done in this branch.

---

### Important Notes
- Always uncheck **“Copy the `main` branch only”** when forking. Otherwise you won’t see `Competition_CODS`.  
- Even though other branches are copied, you only need to use **`Competition_CODS`** for this competition.


## 2. Clone to Your Local Machine (Using GitHub Desktop)

Once you have forked the repository on GitHub, you may want to work with it locally on your computer.  
Here we use **GitHub Desktop** to illustrate the process.

---

### Step 1 — Install GitHub Desktop
1. Download GitHub Desktop from: https://desktop.github.com  
2. Install and open the application.  
3. Sign in with your GitHub account.

---

### Step 2 — Locate Your Fork
1. In your browser, go to your forked repository:  
   `https://github.com/<your-username>/AssetOpsBench`
2. Click the green **Code** button.  
3. Select **Open with GitHub Desktop**.  
   - This will launch GitHub Desktop and prepare to clone your fork.

---

### Step 3 — Choose the Local Path
1. In GitHub Desktop, choose where to save the project locally.  
2. Set the path to:
	local path:  <your_local_directory>/codabench/AssetOpsBench
	

### Step 4 — Switch to the `Competition_CODS` Branch
⚠️ For this competition, you must work **only** on the `Competition_CODS` branch.

1. In GitHub Desktop, use the **Current Branch** dropdown (top bar).  
2. Select `Competition_CODS` from the list.  
   - If you don’t see it, ensure you unchecked “Copy the main branch only” when you forked.

---

### Step 5 — Verify
1. The branch name shown at the top of GitHub Desktop should be **Competition_CODS**.  
2. Confirm the file view matches the content of this branch.

---

✅ You have successfully cloned your fork locally with GitHub Desktop and switched to the **`Competition_CODS`** branch. All further work should be done in this branch.



## 3. Docker Setup (Vendor‑Agnostic — Rancher Desktop as Example)

You can use **any Docker‑compatible engine**. Popular choices include:

- **Docker Desktop** (macOS/Windows) — most common, easy setup.
- **Rancher Desktop** (macOS/Windows/Linux) — open‑source; great Apple Silicon support. **We’ll use this as the example.**
- **Colima** (macOS) — lightweight, Homebrew‑friendly.
- **Podman / Podman Desktop** (Linux/macOS/Windows) — Docker‑compatible CLI via `podman`.

> **Tip:** Run **only one** engine at a time. If multiple are installed, whichever provides the `docker` CLI on your `PATH` will “win.”

### 3.1 Choose, Install & (If Using Rancher Desktop) Configure
1. **Pick one engine** above and install it.
2. **If using Rancher Desktop** → **Preferences** → **Virtual Machine → Emulation**:
   - **Virtual Machine Type**  
     - `VZ` (recommended on Apple Silicon) → uses Apple’s Virtualization framework.  
     - `QEMU` → software emulator (slower; use only if VZ is unavailable).  
   - **VZ Options**: enable **Rosetta support** to run `amd64` (x86) Docker images on Apple Silicon.
3. Click **Apply**. Rancher Desktop restarts with the new settings.

### 3.2 Verify the Docker CLI
Confirm that the `docker` command points to your chosen engine and the daemon is running:

```bash
docker version
docker info
docker context ls
which docker
```

**Expected path (example for Rancher Desktop):**
```
~/.rd/bin/docker
```
- On macOS this expands to `/Users/<your-username>/.rd/bin/docker`.  
- On Linux it often expands to `/home/<your-username>/.rd/bin/docker` (example).  

If you see `/usr/local/bin/docker`, another runtime (e.g., Docker Desktop) is active. Quit it and ensure your chosen engine is running.  
If needed, switch contexts (examples):  
```bash
docker context use rancher-desktop   # Rancher Desktop
docker context use default           # Docker Desktop
docker context use colima            # Colima
```


### 3.3 (If Kubernetes is On) Ensure Certificates Are Fresh
If you enable Kubernetes in Rancher Desktop, its certificates can expire and block startup.

**Quick checks:**
```bash
kubectl version
kubectl get nodes
kubectl cluster-info
```

**If errors mention expired or invalid certificates:**
- In Rancher Desktop: **Preferences → Kubernetes → Reset Kubernetes** (regenerates certificates).  
- If problems persist: **Preferences → Troubleshooting → Factory Reset** (removes images/containers and resets certificates).

## 4. Environment Variables

You can use [.env](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/Competition_CODS/benchmark/cods_track2/.env) or add your environment variables to `.env` which can be passed to containers through `docker-compose.yml`.

Fill in your `.env` file with the following:

```env
HF_APIKEY= <<Hugging face API key>>
WATSONX_APIKEY=
WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=
WATSONX_URL=

## 5. Build and Run


### Pre-built Docker Images
We provide two base Docker images `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-basic` and `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-extra` which serves as the AssetOpsBench environment. The base images provide
- `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-basic`: A minimal Python 3.12 environment with only essential Python packages installed. Suitable for lightweight benchmarking tasks or custom setup.
- `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-extra`: A full-featured Python 3.12 environment with all components pre-installed, including Individual agents (e.g., IoT Agent), MetaAgent, and AgentHive.

The python environment in both docker images use Conda to manage. The name of pre-built Conda environment is `assetopsbench`. For full list of installed packages, please refer to [basic_requirements.txt](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/basic_requirements.txt) and [extra_requirements.txt](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/extra_requirements.txt).


### Run Benchmark Script
In [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/Competition_CODS/benchmark/cods_track2/docker-compose.yml), we mount the benchmark scripts ([entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/cods_track2/entrypoint.sh) and [run_track_2.py](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/cods_track2/run_track_2.py) and scenario files as volumes to assetopsbench container.

Now we run the following command,

```commandline
cd /path/to/AssetOpsBench
chmod +x benchmark/cods_track2/entrypoint.sh
docker-compose -f benchmark/cods_track2/docker-compose.yml up
```

 Note that in `entrypoint.sh`, we activate the python environment by `conda activate assetopsbench` first.
