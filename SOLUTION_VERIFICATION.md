## 🧪 Code Quality Checks

### Syntax Validation
```
✅ Track 1: No syntax errors
✅ Track 2: No syntax errors
```

### Import Warnings (Non-critical)
```
⚠️ pydantic: Not resolved (installed in Docker)
⚠️ reactxen: Not resolved (installed in Docker)
Status: These are expected and will work in the Docker environment
```

### Logic Validation

#### Track 1
- ✅ Agent descriptions properly formatted
- ✅ Prompt structure maintains required format
- ✅ All agent fields accessed safely
- ✅ Dictionary lookups protected

#### Track 2
- ✅ Quality scoring bounded [0.0, 1.0]
- ✅ Fallback loops have proper bounds
- ✅ Exception handling comprehensive
- ✅ Memory appending maintains order
- ✅ Helper method properly defined

## 📊 Functional Testing Readiness

### Track 1 Test Scenarios
1. **Single agent task** - Agent description should display
2. **Multiple agent task** - All agents listed with capabilities
3. **Complex task** - Plan should have ≤5 steps
4. **Simple task** - Plan should minimize steps

### Track 2 Test Scenarios
1. **Primary agent success** - Should use first agent
2. **Primary agent failure** - Should fallback to secondary
3. **Low quality response** - Should trigger fallback
4. **All agents fail** - Should handle gracefully
5. **High quality response** - Should accept and continue
